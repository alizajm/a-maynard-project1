          Born November 12th 1996, and raised in Berkeley, California, Aliza is currently a part-time practicing artist with a focus in 
        intaglio etchings, drawing, and photography. Though her interests span many different mediums, these are her current ones of choice.
        She approaches her work without much intention, finding inspiration through the mundanity of life and the ways in which, as a child, 
        she was able to find such complextiy and intrigue in these otherwise overlooked spaces. In an attempt to re-connect to that level of imagination, she is often
        searching for solutions on how to combine reality with the illusory. Though her process leans towards a search for joy and wonder, the work itself tends to obtain a sort of darkness 
        or feeling of discomfort that harkens to the freakish world that is adulthood.<br>
        <br>

        Aliza graduated from UCLA's Fine Arts Department with a BA in 2020. Her last class fell on the day of the U.S. shutdown for Covid-19. 
      This left her with a difficult choice when it came to what was to happen next in her practice. She continued to live in Los Angeles for the first 
    nine months of lockdown, surviving off of the governments' pandemic unemeployment insurance. One would think this excess of free time would
    lend itself to a productive period of artistic development. However, she found herself less creatively inclined, and falling fast into feelings of apathy 
    and disinterest. Since that time she has moved back home to Berkeley to live with her Dad. Gradually, she has begun re-intoducting herself to her own practice. 
    Finding a community of other artists in the Bay Area has been an incredible help, particularly through a membership at a studio called Max's Garage Press,
    where she finally had a space, with ample resources, to create prints again. Though the true blessing came from the relationships she fostered within the space itself, and the feelings of 
    unwavering support she felt from people she barely knew. <br>
    <br>
   Since then she has begun a new job at a textile screen printing shop in San Francisco, and her realtionship with art is rebuilding, slowly but surely, with a heightened self-assurance that her pace is 
   her own and only to be compared to itself.
