                <h3>HISTORY OF PRINTMAKING</h3>
                      <div>
                        <h4><i>INTAGLIO</i></h4>
                        <h5><u>ETCHING</u></h5>
                        <p>
                              Etching is the most popular and most useful technique in printmaking, because it allows a lot of freedom for artistic expression. 
                          It is a chemical process, in which the matrix is created by submerging a metal plate into an acid or mordant. 
                          Depending on the type of metal (as with engraving, copper plates and zinc are most widespread), different acids are used, 
                          most commonly diluted nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, and iron chloride.
                          <br><br>
                              Most of these acids are very aggressive and give off toxic fumes, 
                          with the exception of ferric chloride. Ferric chloride is a type of mordant based on corrosive salt crystals, 
                          and it has long been valued by printmakers for its safety and accuracy. The process of etching with ferric is very slow, 
                          but since the end of the 1990s, it has been perfected the Edinburgh Etch, consisting of four parts ferric chloride 
                          solution and one part citric acid solution, works well on all types of metal plates and at greater speed. 
                          Innovations like the Edinburgh Etch are part of a growing concern for the environment among contemporary printmakers.

                <p class="panel">
                  The plate is covered with an etching ground (tar, asphaltum, oil pastel, and sometimes even spray paint) 
                  to protect the surface from exposure to the acid, and parts of the ground are then removed to create a drawing. 
                  The back of the plate can be covered in brown tape to protect it from the acid. Different sizes and types of needles 
                  and tools can be used to create a sketch on the dried ground (You can use a sharp nail, a cheap option), exposing thinner 
                  and thicker layers to the acid.
                  <br> <br>
                  Once the etching process is finished, the ground is removed with paint thinner or methylated spirits, and printmaking 
                  ink is applied onto the plate using the same principle of engraving. Depending on the strength of the acid and the length
                   of exposure (etching) the carved lines in the ground become lighter and darker lines on the print. If the plate is wiped 
                   thoroughly before printing, the print looks very much like an ink drawing. Intaglio prints can only be printed using a printmaking
                    press, and the process requires higher quality 150-300g printmaking paper which can withstand being submerged in water.

                <h5><u>AQUATINT</u></h5>
                <p>
                  The aquatint process is younger than engraving and etching as it took artists more time to discover the right sequence of steps
                   and recipes. The exact date and circumstances of the discovery are unclear, but no historical account of aquatint goes back
                    further than the second half of the 18th century. Visually, the technique looks very similar to ink wash and it can be used 
                    to represent brushstrokes, although the differences in value between surfaces are sharper than in aquarelle and ink painting.
                    <br><br>
                    The process itself hasn't changed much over the past two and a half centuries. In order to achieve balanced exposure to acids, 
                    the metal plate (prepared in the same way as with other techniques, making sure there is no grease on the surface) is covered 
                    by a thin layer of powdered rosin or colophonium. The powder is heated up at a high temperature until it melts, forming 
                    protective droplets that stick to the metal plate (matrix).

                <h5><u>DRYPOINT</u></h5>
                <p>
                  Drypoint is a popular type of intaglio printmaking because it's a non-toxic, mechanical method, less complicated than etching 
                  and less physically demanding than engraving. It is often used in addition to other techniques as it is perfect for initial 
                  sketching on the plate, or fixing small mistakes on an etched matrix.
                    <br><br>  
                  The matrix is usually a copper or zinc plate (although new materials like plexiglass are nowadays becoming increasingly popular)
                   and lines are scratched directly onto it with a steel needle making it much closer to drawing than any other technique. 
                   While it is great for making fresh sketches, drypoint is not very useful for creating a large number of impressions because 
                   the needle doesn't scratch far beneath the surface of the plate.
